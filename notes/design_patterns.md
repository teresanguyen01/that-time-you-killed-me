# Design Patterns

### Why do we learn design patterns?

1. Can speed up development
2. less likely you need to refactor later
3. make code more readable to others who know the pattern
4. build up a vocablary to communicate designs with other developers/managers

## Categories

There are three categories to design patterns:

- Creational category is ways to manage the creation of objects
- Structural is organizing classes and objects to provide new functionality
- Behavioral is how to manage communication between objects

## Iterator Pattern

The iterator pattern is a behavioral pattern and an iterator object is created to traverse elements from another object and traverse without exposing the internanl structure/representation of the object. You can add a new iterator for new traversal methods without changing the original object's interface.
